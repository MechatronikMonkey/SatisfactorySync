# SatisfactorySync v0.1.0 - alpha

This is the first version of my Satisfactory Savegame Sync Tool.

## Use cases
If you play satisfactory with lets say 3 people; A, B and C.
A starts the Server and you all play together. 

The next day, A has not time to play (and start the server for B and C).
But B and C want to continue the game without A.
B or C needs the save game to be able to load and continue the game.

SatisfactorySync helps doing that task with the help of an FTP Sever

### Why FTP?
Everyone can get a free FTP server nowadays. You do not need a complicated api key, cloud access or crap.
Just the FTP login credentials and you are good to go. Share the credentials with your frieds who play.
And do not hand them to others and you should be save.

## Installation
Unzip the downloaded Release into any folder you like.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b1aeb6a-da5f-412e-940d-48dd7c6e26b9)

Best would be some space in your user path like C:\Users\yourUserName\SatisfactorySync

Enter folder and Run SatisfactorySyncV0_1.exe

## First Start
As the software is not signed, windows complains about that.
click "more information" to show an extra icon

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d91886b-d9a8-4597-add9-6dde925f5b6c)


Click "Run"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/688d3f2b-766c-43fa-be1e-91aa4e81ca18)


After the first start, the software tries to connect to the ftp server.
This should fail as you have not entered the credentials.

This is all ok for now.
Form here there are **two cases**. You may download a game a friends already uploaded or you first upload a game.

## Download existing game ##

### Import Settings ###
If your friend has started a game, he should export his settings (see below) and provide the settings file to you.
Save it to your computer and open it with import... under Settings tab.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50051bad-0447-4ca2-8328-58ba1648c401)

After you selected the file you are prompted to enter your name. Lets assume we are player-B

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c54a9961-346f-4159-a7c0-316857015492)

After successfull import of the proper settings you should see "Status update erfolgreich..." on the bottom of the app.

### Manually insert settings ###

If you enter your credentials manually, you first get an error message as long as no settings file is provided.
To make it easy for you to pick the correct settings file, you can use the picker.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b84d0cc7-b8a8-4cc3-a480-3ea938a6fa4c)

Pick the correct settings file to your game. You may need to talk to your frieds ;-)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b5d3882-c300-4afd-8d17-b8bbc7244fae)

After picking the correct settings file you should see proper connection on the bottom of the app.

**DO NOT ENTER A SAVEGAME path if you are DOWNLOADING a save game for the first time!** 
You will be prompted on downloading the first time.

Press **Save**


Go back to Sync Page and

## First dowload of a game ##

If you just entered your settings and want to download a game that has never been downloaded before, you should see something like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef4ffbc6-1895-44cb-866c-925432aaab74)

Press the red DOWN arrow to download the savegame for the first time.
You will be prompted to select the correct save game. The list you see is a list from the server.
Pick the correct save game (you may need to talk to your friends) here and press "Ausw√§hlen".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf05d292-cbb6-4754-ae10-4fdbf308d049)

After that a new window will appear for you to select the destination of that savegame.
Locate it under something like this: C:\Users\yourUsername\AppData\Local\FactoryGame\Saved\SaveGames\YourSteamID\YourSaveGameName.sav
DO NOT change the name that is provided for the .sav file. This will break sync! Just use default name provided.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5b550bb-253c-4d0b-9f57-be50891df470)

Press Save!

You now get **three** messages, one for successfull download, one for successfull update of XML file to the server and one for successfull save all settings.

## Ready Setup looks like this ##

If everything is correct, you see a screen like this

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84f49e0f-a6e1-40e4-8594-b9075416c89c)

What you can see here is, that player-A uploaded the game at 05:30:25
And player-B downloaded it at 06:05:34

So you can assume, that player B is still playing, as he has no re uploaded the savegame.

## Third player interrupts while others are playing ##

If a third player tries to download the game while others are playing (lets assume player-C), he sees an error message:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c35416ba-d482-4b93-9c93-84b4c807c514)

Best is to press "Nein" here. Otherwise it will download the game and set last download user to player-C.
But you can press "Ja" to download save game anyway. Now you are the one with the last download.
Talk to each other, and only click "Ja" if you are absolutely shure!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a636dad0-5e41-4b6b-b057-62923c2e0e8a)

But before it was player-B who downloaded the game and started to play.
If he (player-B) now tries to upload his finished save game, he will see the following message:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8134c884-9a2c-45ab-be64-4717b31aa824)

Because player C downloaded the game in parallel and may also play on the same save game base.

If you press "Ja" the upload will continue and you are the uploader of the last save now **overwriting** the last upload from player-A






## Start a new game
First of all get the ftp credentials of a free ftp server or your webspace ftp or the fpt of a friend or so.
Switch to settings tab and enter the credentials along with your name.

For this example we are player-A.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d322b952-db0d-45e0-ac99-8a06fe13cf4f)

1. Enter YOUR Name here
2. Enter FTP credentials
3. Enter a NEW NAME (must be unique on server) for a settings file. Give it a good name, mabe the players curently playing. 
   In this case we assume that Player A, B and C are playing.
   Must be .xml in the end! **Enter this manually**. DO NOT pick it with the picker if you create a new game!

4. Use the picker to select the save game you want to share with your frieds. It tries to throw you in the default save game path
   of satisfactory. However, this may fail. Your save game should be located C:\Users\yourUsername\AppData\Local\FactoryGame\Saved\SaveGames\YourSteamID\YourSaveGameName.sav

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c07f601-3c8b-48ca-8383-00a893222cb3)

   pick it and press open.

Now you have entered all you need to upload your first save game.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5c59cbe-b333-4f45-b8f6-b5cedb977941)

Press SAVE and go back to the Sync Page for the first upload.

### First Upload ###
Switch to Sync Tab if not allready done.
As you see there is no name or date for up and downloads of this savegame to your ftp server.
This is because you never uploaded the savegame.

So klick the green upload arrow to first upload the save game to the server.
After clicking the upload button you should see **two** "226 Transfer complete" message, one for the sav game and one for the xml settings file.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd937291-916f-4cfe-bbd8-abcf294e02d1)

After that is completed, you see "Status update erfolgreich..." in the bottom and the LastUploaded from and last UPloaded date filled.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e651785-08c0-4cc7-8741-bc08ed7fd4e2)

## Export settings ###
After your first upload you should save the settings for your friends to make it easyier for them to setup.
Go to Settings tab and click export

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b5d373-6e48-47ee-a5ec-4b4c426c9a0a)

Save the xml file and share it with your friends by discord or email.
